mangafuse
===========

mangafuse lets you access your mangas from an online reader like any file on your desktop.

Install 
--------

To install mangafuse on linux open a command line and do:

**sudo** *apt-get install git*
**git** *clone git://github.com/joe42/mangafuse.git*
**sudo apt-get** *install python-setuptools*
**cd** *CloudFusion/cloudfusion/*
**sudo python** *setup.py install*


Get started
------------

**./start_mangafuse.sh**


This will open your file browser in the mangafuse directory. There is already one directory with mangas inside. 
To access other mangas, simply create a new folder here. So assuming that you would like to read a manga called bleach, simply create a folder called bleach. 
It will contain all currently available chapters.


Notes
------

Please do not copy complete folders. This would put a huge load on the servers.
