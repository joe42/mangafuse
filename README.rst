mangafuse
===========

mangafuse lets you access your mangas from an online reader like any file on your desktop.

Install 
--------

To install mangafuse on linux download the install script. From the command line you can type:

wget https://raw.github.com/joe42/mangafuse/master/install.sh

As root, start the install script from the command line:

**bash** *install.sh*


Get started
------------

Just type the following in the command line:

**mangafuse**


This will open your file browser in the mangafuse directory. There is already one directory with mangas inside. 
To access other mangas, simply create a new folder here. So assuming that you would like to read a manga called bleach, simply create a folder called bleach. 
It will contain all currently available chapters.

Problems
----------

The first time you access a folder it may take some time to cache the files. But further accesses should be reasonably fast.


Notes
------

Please do not copy complete folders. This would put a huge load on the servers.
